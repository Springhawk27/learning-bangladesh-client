SQL is a relational database where it stores the related data in a tabular form. It has predefined schema. SQL data is better for multi-row transactions.
                                On the other hand, NoSQL database is non-relational which is horizontally scalable. NoSQL is unstructured data with dynamic schema. NoSQL is actually better for unstructured data such as JSON.

It is the most commonly used with libraries such as Angular, React. Since redux maintains the state of the application it is basically used to manage the state in a single state tree which becomes handy when the application is too large and has too many states but gets complicated if itâ€™s a simple application and has less states.

This means the declaration of let and const will not  rise to the top of the current execution context. Therefore it will throw a reference error if we try to call it before  initialization. So from the beginning of that block to the initialization of that variable is known as the temporal dead zone for that variable.
